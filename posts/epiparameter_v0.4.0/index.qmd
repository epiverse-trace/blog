We are very excited to announce the release of a new [epiparameter](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/epiparameter) version v0.4.0. This is the first version of epiparameter to be on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/package=epiparameter) (the package can now be installed with `install.packages()`).
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

The fourth minor release of the {epiparameter} focuses on splitting the code and data, with the data being moved into a separate R package: [{epiparameterDB}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=epiparameterDB). There are also some minor additional improvements focusing on printing and plotting.

## New features

* The library of epidemiological parameters (`parameters.json`) has been removed from the {epiparameter} package and moved to the {epiparameterDB} R package which is taken on as a dependency. The {epiparameter} package is licensed solely as MIT with dual licensing with CC0 removed (#415).
* The data dictionary (`data_dictionary.json`) and JSON validation workflow (`validate-json.yaml`) have been removed from the package (#415).
* The library of epidemiological parameters is cached (using [{cachem}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=cachem)) on loading the package to reduce the runtime of `epiparameter_db()` (#417).
* The `print()` and `format()` methods for the `<epiparameter>` class have been improved to show the units of parameter estimates, as well as summary statistics, if available, for unparameterised `<epiparameter>` objects (#419).
* `on.exit()` is no longer called in plotting functions to allow user-specified graphical parameters to not be overwritten (#420).
* A `plot()` method for the `<multi_epiparameter>` class is added. This enables a list of `<epiparameter>` objects with continuous distributions to be compared on a single plot (#425).
* A `lines()` method for the `<epiparameter>` class is added (#425).

## Breaking changes

* None

## Bug fixes

* A bug in `is_continuous()` causing it to incorrectly returning `FALSE` for `<epiparameter>` objects with normal distributions is fixed (#422).

## Deprecated and defunct

* None
