The principal aim of this release is to simplify, clarify and enhance the classes and class methods when working with epidemiological parameters in R. \n\nThe are a large number of ***breaking changes*** in this release, primarily functions and function arguments being renamed or restructured, see the _Breaking changes_ section for an overview.\n\n## New features\n\n* The library of epidemiological parameters has been updated to include 3 new Chikungunya parameter entries. The Mpox parameters previously missing from the Guzzetta et al. entry have been added (#346 & #374).\n* A `c()` method has been added for `<epiparameter>` and `<multi_epiparameter>` objects (#368).\n* An `aggregate()` method has been added for `<multi_epiparameter>` to enable consensus distributions to be built utilising the mixture distribution class from [{distributional}](https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=distributional) (#388).\n* Infrastructure has been added to the package to allow translations of messages/warnings/errors printed to the console. (@Bisaloo, #367).\n* `convert_summary_stats_to_params()` can now convert from median and dispersion for a lognormal distribution (#378).\n* The `data_dictionary.json` has been enhanced to improve validation of the library of epidemiological parameters (`parameters.json`) (#379).\n* An interactive network showing all of the `<epiparameter>` S3 methods has been added to the `design_principles.Rmd` vignette (#383).\n* The `data_from_epireview.Rmd` article has been improved and updated with new changes from {epireview} (@CarmenTamayo & @cm401 & @kellymccain28, #305 & #373).\n* Parameter units have been added to every entry in the {epiparameter} library (`parameters.json`) and to the `$metadata` element in `<epiparameter>` objects. The `create_metadata()` function now has a `units` argument to construct metadata lists (#391).\n* Improved `database.Rmd` vignette by adding a short citation to the reference column (@jamesmbaazam, #348).\n* The `family()` method for `<epiparameter>` has been improved to allow access to distribution names for transformed (e.g. `mixture` and `truncated` distributions) and untransformed (e.g. `gamma` and `lognormal`) distributions with a new argument `base_dist` and a new internal function `.distributional_family()` (#398).\n* `as_epiparameter()` can now work with the SARS parameters from {epireview} (#407).\n\n## Breaking changes\n\n* The `<epidist>` class has been renamed `<epiparameter>` to avoid confusion with the similar R package [{epidist}](https://github.com/epinowcast/epidist) (#360).\n* Many functions that used `epidist` in their names have been renamed to use `epiparameter` due to the renaming of the class (#360).\n* The function signatures of `epiparameter()` and `new_epiparameter()` functions (previously `epidist()` and `new_epidist()`) have been updated to collapse the `prob_dist`, `prob_dist_params`, `discretise` and `truncation` arguments into `prob_distribution`, which accepts the output of `create_prob_distribution()` (#381).\n* The `epi_dist` argument has been renamed `epi_name`. This is to clarify that {epiparameter} can work with epidemiological parameters that take a variety of forms (e.g. point estimates, ranges, probability distributions, etc.) (#390).\n* The `<vb_epidist>` class and it's methods have been removed from the package. It was not being used and was increasing the complexity and maintenance load of the package (#359).\n* `create_prob_dist()` has been renamed to `create_prob_distribution()` (#381).\n* `validate_epiparameter()` (previously `validate_epidist()`) has been renamed `assert_epiparameter()`, and `test_epiparameter()` has been added, with the aim to harmonise design with [{contactmatrix}](https://github.com/socialcontactdata/contactmatrix) and the messages and errors have been improved (#366 & #402).\n* The minimum version of R required by the package is now 4.1.0 due to the use of the base R pipe (`|>`) in dependencies, and the R-CMD-check workflow on GitHub actions now explicitly runs on the minimum version of R stated in the `DESCRIPTION` (#384 & #405). \n\n## Bug fixes\n\n* Epidemiological parameter entries in the library stored with lognormal distributions, parameterised as median and dispersion are now converted to meanlog and sdlog correctly when creating an `<epiparameter>` (when `auto_calc_params = TRUE`) (#381).\n\n## Deprecated and defunct\n\n* `epidist_db()` has been deprecated. It is replaced by `epiparameter_db()` (#360 & #399).\n\n\n## Acknowledgements\n\n\n\n[&#x0040;Bisaloo](https://github.com/Bisaloo) [&#x0040;CarmenTamayo](https://github.com/CarmenTamayo) [&#x0040;adamkucharski](https://github.com/adamkucharski) [&#x0040;avallecam](https://github.com/avallecam) [&#x0040;chartgerink](https://github.com/chartgerink) [&#x0040;jamesmbaazam](https://github.com/jamesmbaazam) [&#x0040;joshwlambert](https://github.com/joshwlambert)\n",
