We are very excited to announce the release of a new simulist version v0.2.0.
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

Second release of _simulist_, updates the core simulation model and, as a result, the arguments for `sim_*()` functions for simulating line list data and/or contact table data exported from _simulist_ are updated. The internal package architecture is also refactored.

## New features

### External

* `create_config()` now returns a new element in the list: `$network`. By default `create_config()` returns `network = "adjusted"`, which assumes the simulation is a random network and samples contacts with an excess degree distribution (see Details in `?create_config()`). The network effect can be changed to `"unadjusted"` to _switch off_ the network effect. `$network` is checked internally (in `.sim_network_bp()`) and will error if not valid (#60).
* Package architecture diagram is added to `design-principles.Rmd` (#66).
* lintr GitHub action workflow (`lint-changed-files.yaml`) is added to the suite of continuous integration workflows (#68).
* Transmission chain visualisation is added to `vis-linelist.Rmd` (#70).

### Internal

* `.sim_network_bp()` is added as an internal function and replaces `bpmodels::chain_sim()` as the core simulation model producing contacted and infected individuals. `{bpmodels}` is removed as a dependency as a result (#60).
* `.sample_names()` is added as an internal function to utilise `randomNames::randomNames()` to produce more unique names than `randomNames(..., sample.with.replacement = FALSE)`.
* Refactor of internal simulation architecture replaced `.sim_bp_linelist()`, `.sim_clinical_linelist()` and `.sim_contacts_tbl()` with `.sim_internal()` (#66).
* The `sim_utils.R` file was renamed to `utils.R` (#66) and the empty `create_linelist.R` file was removed (#72).
* `.add_date_contact()` argument `outbreak_start_date` is now `NULL` by default instead of missing (#82).
* Regression tests of `sim_*()` functions now use [snapshot testing](https://testthat.r-lib.org/articles/snapshotting.html) for more detailed data checking (#65).
* Internal testing data (`testdata`) files have been updated, as has the `testdata/README.md` with instructions (#64).

## Breaking changes

* `R` and `serial_interval` arguments have been removed from `sim_linelist()`, `sim_contacts()` and `sim_outbreak()` functions and instead `contact_distribution`, `contact_interval` and `prob_infect` are used to parameterise the simulation. Documentation, both functions and vignettes, have been updated with these changes (#60).
* The `contact_distribution` argument in `sim_*()` functions requires a density function if supplied as an anonymous function. Information is added to `simulist.Rmd` to explain this.
* The line list output from `sim_linelist()` now uses column header `sex` instead of `gender`. The contacts table output from `sim_contacts()` and `sim_outbreak()` now uses column headers `age` and `sex` instead of `cnt_age` and `cnt_gender` (#60, #79).
* `contact_distribution` is redefined and redocumented as the distribution of contacts per individual, rather than the number of contacts that do not get infected as it was in v0.1.0.
* `row.names` for `<data.frame>`s output by `sim_linelist()`, `sim_contacts()` and `sim_outbreak()` are now sequential from `1:nrows` (#63).

## Bug fixes

* `sim_contacts()` now correctly runs with an age-structured population. In the previous version (v0.1.0), `sim_contacts()` did not call `.check_age_df()` and as a result the function errored, this is fixed as of PR #81.

## Deprecated and defunct

* None
