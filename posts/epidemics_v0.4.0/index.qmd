We are very excited to announce the release of a new epidemics version v0.4.0.
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

Maintainer is changing to @rozeggo.

## Model functions

1. Internal model functions for the models which allow vaccination have been corrected to prevent vaccination introducing negative values of susceptibles; tests added to check for this (#235, initially reported by @avallecam).

## Helper functions

1. Added the `epidemic_peak()` function to calculate the timing and size of the largest peak in each compartment in an scenario model (#240) by @bahadzie.

2. Added the `outcomes_averted()` function to compare epidemic scenarios (e.g. with and without interventions or vaccination) (#225, #230).

## Documentation

1. Adds a developer-focused vignette on how to modify epidemics and model structures to address potential modelling requests or tasks (#210).

2. Splits up the 'Modelling uncertainty and scenarios' vignette into separate vignettes on uncertainty and scenario comparisons (#225).

3. Removed unnecessary plots from the vignette on modelling vaccination (#235).

4. Fixed link to _socialmixr_ package in the 'Get started' and 'Modelling interventions' vignettes.

5. Updated and added documentation for all new or modified functions.

6. Updated references JSON file.

## Package

1. Updated Codecov GitHub Actions workflow to restore code coverage reporting.

2. Updated package title and citation file. 

3. Updated `_pkgdown.yaml` with new vignette and updated section titles.

4. Updated WORDLIST.
