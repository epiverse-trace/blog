We are very excited to announce the release of a new finalsize version v0.2.1.
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

This patch adds:

1. Default values for the contact matrix, susceptibility matrix, and susceptibility distribution matrix to allow quick estimates of final size for a given $R_0$ in a population with homogeneous mixing and full susceptibility (#180);

2. Combines the documentation for the functions `r_eff()`, `r0_to_lambda()`, and `lambda_to_r0()` under the name 'r0_conversions';

3. Adds vignettes on the theoretical background and on projecting re-emergence of a disease due to demographic turnover (#193, #194 by @adamkucharski);

4. Streamlines the examples in the Readme;

5. Replaces the PNG logo in the Readme with an SVG version;

6. Updates the GitHub Actions workflow YAMLs, the `.lintr` config file, `_pkgdown.yml`, `.Rbuildignore`, `CITATION.cff` and `CRAN-SUBMISSION`; workflows and configuration files bring the package in line with {packagetemplate} (#181, #186, #188).

7. Standardises the `DESCRIPTION` file.

8. Adds package-level documentation.

9. Adds spellchecking and the `WORDLIST` file.

10. Adds tools to check that the package does not modify the global state, code to flag any partial matching of function arguments,.

11. Updates references cited in the vignettes.
