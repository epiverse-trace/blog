## Questions & answers

> Will `{cleanepi}` package have an option to create new columns and to perform other actions such as filtering and sorting data?

Some cleaning processes in the `{cleanepi}` package actually create new columns. `{cleanepi}` does data filtering but not data sorting, which can be done with other existing packages.

> When will the `{readepi}` and `{cleanepi}` packages be available on CRAN?

These packages are still in development stage, and we intend to submit them to CRAN soon.

> Does `{cleanepi}` has an option to show which IDs are been cleaned? This will help to inform the curators about which ID as wrong?

Yes, `{cleanepi}` reports any change to the end-user.

> Will there be a package in epiverse for spatial analysis to visualize distribution of cases during epidemics?

Yes. We intend to create a package for visualization.

> Have you thought about combining the epiverse packages into a single package (like tidyverse package for example) so the user won’t have to load the packages one by one?

Yes. In fact such package is already under development, see [epiverse](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiverse).

> Can the epiverse be used to model severity or case fatality of outbreaks against counter factual to proof effectiveness of disease control interventions?\

For this, we would say that Epiverse-TRACE packages such as `{cfr}` provide robust methods for computing unbiased and timely case fatality ratios. With such knowledge, it is up to the user to decide whether or not control measures are effective.

> Is there any plan to account for genomic data?

Yes. We intend to create a package for reading and integrating genomic data with case data.
