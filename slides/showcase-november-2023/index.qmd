## Questions & answers
1. will `{cleanepi}` package have an option to create new columns and to perform other actions such as filtering and sorting data?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Ans__: Some cleaning processes in the `{cleanepi}` package actually create new columns. `{cleanepi}` does data filtering but not data sorting, which can be done with other existing packages.\
2. when will the `{readepi}` and `{cleanepi}` packages be available on CRAN?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Ans__: These packages are still in development stage, and we intend to submit them to CRAN soon.\
3. does `{cleanepi}` has an option to show which IDs are been cleaned? This will help to inform the curators about which ID as wrong?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Ans__: Yes, `{cleanepi}` reports any change to the end-user.\  
4. Will there be a package in epiverse for spatial analysis to visualize distribution of cases during epidemics?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Ans__: Yes. We intend to create a package for visualization.\
5. have you thought about combining the epiverse packages into a single package (like tidyverse package for example) so the user won’t have to load the packages one by one?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Ans__:  Yes. In fact such package is already under development, see [epiverse](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiverse).\
6. can the epiverse be used to model severity or case fatality of outbreaks against counter factual to proof effectiveness of disease control interventions?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Ans__: To this, we would say that epiverse-TRACE packages such as `{cfr}` provide robust methods for computing unbaised and timely case fatality ratios. With such knowledge, it is up to the user to decide whether or not control measures are effective. \
7. is there any plan to account for genomic data?\
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;__Ans__:  Yes. We intend to create a package for reading and integrating genomic data with case data.
