We are very excited to announce the release of a new vaccineff version v1.0.0.
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

`{vaccineff 1.0.0}` refactors the package's internal structure for better 
maintainability.

## Breaking Changes

* **`estimate_vaccineff()`** replaces `effectiveness()`.  
  - It returns an object of class `vaccineff`.  
  - The `at` parameter must always be provided for accurate results.

* **`plot.vaccineff_data()`** replaces `plot_coverage()`.

* **`cohortdata`** has been simplified and reduced to improve examples and 
  reduce computation time.
