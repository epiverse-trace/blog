This vignette summarises the findings from the *100 days and 100 lines of code* workshop, hosted in December 2022 by [Epiverse-TRACE](https://data.org/news/epiverse-trace-a-values-based-approach-to-open-source-ecosystems/).

To discuss how the first 100 lines of code during an epidemic should look like, we invited 40 experts, including academics, field epidemiologists, and software engineers, to take part in a 3-day workshop, where they discussed the current challenges, and potential solutions, in data analytic pipelines used to analyse epidemic data. In addition to highlighting existing technical solutions and their use cases, presentations on best practices in fostering collaboration across institutions and disciplines set the scene for the subsequent workshop scenario exercises.

### What R packages and tools are available to use during an epidemic?

To investigate this in a similar setting to what an outbreak response team would experience, workshop participants were divided into groups, and asked to develop a plausible epidemic scenario, that included:

- A situation report, describing the characteristics of the epidemic
- A linelist of cases and contact tracing data, by modifying provided datasets containing simulated data
- A set of questions to address during the analytic process

Groups then exchanged epidemic scenarios and analysed the provided data to answer the questions indicated the previous group, as if they were a response team working to solve an outbreak. Details about each of these outbreak scenarios and the analytic pipelines developed by the groups are summarised in this vignette.

### Simulating epidemic data

Before the workshop, a fictitious dataset was created, which consisted of a linelist and contact tracing information.

To generate linelist data, the package [`bpmodels`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/bpmodels) was used to generate a branching process network. Cases were then transformed from the model output to a linelist format. To add plausible hospitalisations and deaths, delay distributions for SARS-CoV were extracted from [`epiparameter`](https://github.com/epiverse-trace/epiparameter).

To create the contact tracing database, a random number of contacts was generated for each of the cases included in the linelist. These contacts were then assigned a category of *became case*, *under follow up* or *lost to follow up*, at random.

- Through this workshop, we identified the need for a tool to simulate outbreak data in a linelist format, to test analysis methods and other packages while having control over the characteristics of the test data. For this purpose, an R package is currently in progress, see [simulist](https://github.com/orgs/epiverse-trace/discussions/46).

## Scenario 1: Novel respiratory disease in The Gambia

![Scenario 1 details](Scenario1smq.png){fig-alt="Situation report: Location: Banjul, The Gambia. Pathogen: novel respiratory disease. Background: index case travelled to London in Dec 2022. 85 symptomatic individuals identified in February 2023 are under investigation. Modified data: linelist: added travel history column, added imported case column, added id column, added missing cases, introduced errors; contact database: added missing cases and introduced errors. Questions: 1. What are the most affected groups? 2. What are the epidemiological characteristics of infection? 2. What is the level of individual variation of transmission? 3. How is the outbreak likely to develop over the next weeks? 4. What public health measures are required to contain it?"}

## Scenario 2: Outbreak of an unidentified disease in rural Colombia

![Scenario 2 details](Scenario2smq.png){fig-alt="Situation report: Location: Ibague, Colombia. Pathogen: unspecified. Background: suspected link to a zoonotic reservoir, since early cases were farmers, envoy is colourblind and unable to deal with complex visual information. Modified data: linelist: added travel to rural area column, added case occupation column, added notification date column, added missing cases and introduced errors. No changes were added to the contact database. Questions: 1. Have there been exposures to a zoonotic reservoir? 2. How transmissible is the disease? 3. What are the hospital bed requirements for next weeks? 4. What is the attack rate and the no. of deaths we expect? 5. Can you reconstruct transmission chains?"}

### Analytic pipeline for scenario 2 (analysed by group 3)

- Data cleaning: manually, using R (no packages specified), to
  - Fix data entry issues in columns *onset_date* and *gender*
  - Check for missing data
  - Check sequence of dates: symptom onset → hospitalisation → death
- Data anonymisation to share with partners
  - [`fastlink`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/fastLink/index.html) for probabilistic matching between cases ↔ contacts, based on names, dates, and ages
- Case demographics
  - [`apyramid`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/apyramid/index.html) to stratify data by age, gender, and health status
- Reproductive number calculation, by using two approaches:
  - Manually, by calculating the number of cases generated by each source case, data management through [`dplyr`](https://dplyr.tidyverse.org) and [`data.table`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/data.table/index.html)
  - Using serial interval of disease, through [`EpiEstim`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/EpiEstim/index.html) or [`EpiNow2`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2)
- Severity of disease
  - Manual calculation of CFR and hospitalisation ratio
- Projection of hospital bed requirements
  - [`EpiNow2`](https://github.com/epiforecasts/EpiNow2) to calculate average hospitalisation duration and forecasting
- Zoonotic transmission of disease
  - Manual inspection of cases' occupation
  - Use of [IQtree](http://www.iqtree.org) and [`ggtree`](https://guangchuangyu.github.io/software/ggtree/) to plot phylogenetic data
- Superspreading
  - [`epicontacts`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/epicontacts/index.html)
- Calculation of attack rate
  - Unable to calculate, given the lack of seroprevalence data

## Scenario 4: Emerging avian influenza in Cambodia

![Scenario 4 details](Scenario4smq.png){fig-alt="Situation report: Location: Phnom Penh, Cambodia. Pathogen: emerging avian influenza. Background: outbreak started in a small rural community of poultry farmers in Cambodia. Cases now also reported in the capital. Modified data: linelist: added outcome column, added origin column, added exposure column, added missing cases, introduced errors. Contact database: no changes were added. Questions: 1. What are the % of human vs zoonotic transmission? 2. What is the epidemic potential? 3. Is the outbreak contained by the implemented measures? 4. What is the severity of disease? 5. Can underreporting be estimated? 6. Are more hospital beds needed? 7. Should they cull poultry farms?"}

## What next?

Scenarios developed by the *100 days* workshop participants illustrate that there are many commonalities across proposed analytics pipelines, which could support interoperability across different epidemiological questions. However, there are also several remaining gaps and challenges, which creates an opportunity to build on existing work to tackle common outbreak scenarios, using the issues here as a starting point. This will also require consideration of wider interactions with existing software ecosystems and users of outbreak analytics insights. We are therefore planning to follow up this vignette with a more detailed perspective article discussing potential for broader progress in developing a 'first 100 lines of code'.
