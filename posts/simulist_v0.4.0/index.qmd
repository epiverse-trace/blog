We are very excited to announce the release of a new [simulist](https://epiverse-trace.github.io/simulist) version v0.4.0.
Here is an automatically generated summary of the changes in this version.

A minor version release of _simulist_ containing various minor improvements to the functions and documentation, as well as removing some triggers for warning users. There are also a few bug fixes and internal enhancements.

## New features

### External

* Defaults have been added to all `sim_*()` arguments that previously did not have one. Allowing functions to be run without specifying any arguments (e.g. `linelist <- sim_linelist()`) (#149).
* Documentation for `sim_*()` function arguments that accept either a `function` or an `<epiparameter>` object has been improved (#149).
* `sim_*()` functions no longer warn if the user has not specified `*_risk` arguments and have set `onset_to_*` arguments to `NULL` (#149).
* All vignettes now use `rmarkdown::html_vignette` for to correctly render the website and for maximum compatibility with {pkgdown} >= 2.1.0. This removes figure numbering and code folding (#153).

### Internal

* `.add_hospitalisation()` has been vectorised following `.add_outcome()` in PR #101 (#150). 

## Breaking changes

* The function arguments `infect_period` and `prob_infect` have been renamed `infectious_period` and `prob_infection` (#143).
* `sim_*()` functions now use `NULL` instead of `NA` to turn off processes (e.g. `onset_to_death = NULL` for no deaths) (#148).

## Bug fixes

* A new function, `.sample_infect_period()` is added that errors if the infectious period function generates a negative number (#142).
* `sim_linelist()` no longer errors when `hosp_death_risk` is `NULL` and `onset_to_death` is parameterised as a delay distribution (#144). 
* `.add_ct()` generates the correct number of values and does not duplicate Ct values due to vector recycling (#158). 
* Update {epiparameter} usage (#159).

## Deprecated and defunct

* None
